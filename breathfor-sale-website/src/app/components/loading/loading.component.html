    <p class="loading__text">‘Breath for Sale’ is a first of its kind NFT (non-fungible token) installation developed in a collaboration between social justice advocates, Web3 developers, legal theorists, technical engineers, and digital artists.</p>
    <p class="loading__text">The project explores how breathing – a process intimately entangled with the social and physical environment – registers in a tokenized market enabled by blockchain technology.</p>
    <p class="loading__text">For the NFT generation, breathing and atmospheric data (i.e. CO2, O2, ethanol temperature, humidity, time, location, etc.) is collected by an in-situ and custom engineered sensing device. Based on the measurement, a unique visualization for each breathing instance is created.</p>
    <p class="loading__text">The question the project addresses is how we can enable collective contributions to a social cause as urgent as a Right to Breathe with wealth, access, and resources distributed so unequally? Moving away from the process of tokenization as a mechanism of extraction, ‘Breath for Sale’ utilizes Web3 tools to create and foster new forms of community empowerment.  Far from providing all the answers, ‘Breath for Sale’ is a mechanism that generates a participatory platform for working together on some of the most pressing social, environmental, economic, and legal challenges posed by breathing injustices in complexly entangled and increasingly digitalized worlds.</p>
    <p class="loading__text">The Initiative is working toward a possible registry of contributions that operates through non-tradable participation tokens. This registry will connect token holders to a treasury distributing part of the funds generated through the ‘Breath for Sale’ installation to community-driven projects advancing efforts toward a Right to Breathe.</p>
